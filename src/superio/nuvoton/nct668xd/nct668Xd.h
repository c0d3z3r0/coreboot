/* WARNING!
 * NCT668XD is a "new generation" SuperIO, which implements parts of its
 * functionality in firmware. That means one should check if the desired
 * function/register is mentioned in the EC Space datasheet before trying
 * to modify any registers in HW.
 * Both datasheets (HW and EC Space) are available on request from Nuvoton.
 *
 * These are the warnings from the datasheet that apply to LDN 7 and 9 (GPIO)
 * 1. All GPIO pin functions should always be customized by firmware. BIOS /
 *    Driver should not touch all configuration registers here and related IO
 *    ports unless firmware opens them.
 * 2. Under any situations, CR30h should always be controlled by EC and never
 *    be opened for BIOS / Drivers !!
 * 3. Some GPIO pin functions were configured when related SW functions of EC
 *    Space were enabled. For such situations BIOS or application programs
 *    should not alter these setting to avoid abnormal function of underlying
 *    firmware. Please refer to EC Space Specification before going to change
 *    any configuration setting of GPIO pins.
